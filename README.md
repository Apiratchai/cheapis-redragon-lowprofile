# cheapis

Cheapis was inspired by ferris and sweep.

It is the cheapest alternative to the above keyboards (that still has a PCB) as it is sub 100x100mm in size so it can be ordered for a very low price and it only needs one controller (Pro Micro or alternative).

The first prototype is on it's way so v0.1 might not even work (but probably will as it is a very simple pcb).

Specs:
- Split
- Unibody
- 34 key
- Compatible with MX, Kailh Choc v1 and Gateron low profile switches
- needs 1n4148 SOD-323 diodes
- 19mm standard spacing

Pros:
- less than 100x100mm
- reversible, so you can order less
- needs ony one Pro Micro or alternative
- very cheap way to experiment with 34 key layout

Cons:
- it has to be unibody
- tenting is not possible
- fragile without a plate as the Pro Micro keeps the two sides together
- not much features, it's hardly more than a hardwire
